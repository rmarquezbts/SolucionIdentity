    <p><b>World War III</b> (<b>WWIII</b> or <b>WW3</b>), also known as the <b>Third World War</b>, is a <a href="/wiki/Hypothetical" class="mw-redirect" title="Hypothetical">hypothetical</a> worldwide military conflict subsequent to <a href="/wiki/World_War" class="mw-redirect" title="World War">World Wars</a> <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">I</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">II</a>. Because of the development and <a href="/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki">use</a> of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> near the end of World War II and their subsequent acquisition and deployment by <a href="/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons" title="List of states with nuclear weapons">many countries</a>, it is feared that a Third World War could lead to a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust" title="Nuclear holocaust">nuclear holocaust</a> causing the end of <a href="/wiki/Civilization" title="Civilization">human civilization</a> and most or all <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">human life</a> on <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. A common hypothesis is that a small number of people could survive such an <a href="/wiki/Armageddon" title="Armageddon">Armageddon</a>, possibly in deep underground <a href="/wiki/Blast_shelter" title="Blast shelter">blast shelters</a> or away from Earth, such as on the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> or <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a> or in <a href="/wiki/Space_vehicle" title="Space vehicle">space vehicles</a>. Another major concern is that <a href="/wiki/Biological_warfare" title="Biological warfare">biological warfare</a> could cause a very large number of casualties, either intentionally or inadvertently by an accidental release of a biological agent, the unexpected mutation of an agent, or its adaptation to other species after use.</p>
    <p>One of the first imagined scenarios, hypothesized shortly after World War II, was a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_war" class="mw-redirect" title="Nuclear war">nuclear war</a> between the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, which emerged as <a href="/wiki/Superpower" title="Superpower">superpowers</a> following World War II. This has been widely <a href="/wiki/World_War_III_in_popular_culture" title="World War III in popular culture">used as a premise or plot device</a> in books, films, television productions, and video games. A few writers have instead applied the term "World War III" to the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, arguing that it met the definition of a <a href="/wiki/World_war" title="World war">world war</a> even though there was no direct armed conflict between the superpowers.</p>
    <p><a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> (1914–1918) was regarded at the time as the "<a href="/wiki/The_war_to_end_war" title="The war to end war">war to end all wars</a>," as it was believed there could never again be another global conflict of such magnitude. <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> (1939–1945) proved that to be false, and with the advent of the Cold War in 1947 and the adoption of nuclear weapons, the possibility of a third global conflict became more plausible. The perceived threat then decreased with the end of the Cold War in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving the United States as the sole global superpower. A Third World War was anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities in many countries. Scenarios ranged from <a href="/wiki/Conventional_warfare" title="Conventional warfare">conventional warfare</a> to limited or total nuclear warfare.</p>
